## Part 1: Import a module that's not in a package

Just like in the last example, add an import statement to the 
`main.py` file to import the `hello()` and `bye()` functions 
in `salutations.py`.

Also like in the last example, import `salutations.py` so that
the calling syntax for `hello()` and `bye()` works as written.

### Expected output

Something like:

```
Please enter your name.
Bax
hello, Bax.
and
goodbye, Bax.
```
