## Part 3: Create a package and import modules from the package with aliases

Again, add an `__init__.py` file to the `driving_pkg` directory to make it a package.

This time, also add import statments that import each module in the package with the aliases used in the body of `main.py`.

### Expected output

```
10 km = 16.09344 mi.
100 miles in 100 minutes averages 60.0 mph.
258 miles on 12 gal of gas is 21.5 mpg.
```
