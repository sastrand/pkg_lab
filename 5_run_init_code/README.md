## Add executable code to __init__.py

`__init__.py` is run the first time anything is imported from its respective package.

To take advantage of this, sometimes setup code is added to `__init__.py`.

For this part of the lab:
	* first hypothesize if you add a print statment to the `__init__.py` file, where and how many times will it print.
	* create an `__init__.py` file containing a print statement and test this hypothesis.
