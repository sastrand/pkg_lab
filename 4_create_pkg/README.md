## 4: Create package and import *

Importing evey name from a package is a bad idea almost all the time, but it's useful to know how it works and how to limit its power in your own package.

In this exercise, add import statements to `main.py` and an `__init__.py` file to the `driving_pkg` directory that will import the names in every module of the `driving_pkg` namespace except those in the module `bad_module`.

### Expected output

```
10 km = 16.09344 mi.
100 miles in 100 minutes averages 60.0 mph.
258 miles on 12 gal of gas is 21.5 mpg.
```
