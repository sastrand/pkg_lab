## 2: Create a package from a directory of modules

A package is a directory of modules that the interpreter manages as a group under a single name.

Add an `__init__.py` file to the `driving_pkg` directory so that the code in `main.py` will run.

### Expected output

```
10 km = 16.09344 mi.
100 miles in 100 minutes averages 60.0 mph.
258 miles on 12 gal of gas is 21.5 mpg.
```
