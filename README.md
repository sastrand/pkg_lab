## A lab to make packages and import modules in Python

Each sub-directory in this repo contains a `main.py` and at least one module.

Follow the directions in each sub-directory's README to import modules and build packages in each.

Linked [here](https://github.com/sastrand/magic_ball) is a similar, small project that may be helpful as a reference.
